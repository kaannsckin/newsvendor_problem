IE313 Supply Chain Management - HW (Supply_Contracts)
Summary:

In this assignment you are going to work on supply contracts.

Assume that there is a household electronics product that has a lifetime of one year. After the year is over, the product does not sell anymore (possibly because of the launch of a new and better version which we do not model). There is a single replenishment opportunity for this product before observing the demand (Newsvendor model assumptions!). 

The yearly demand is normally distributed with a mean of 1450 and a standard deviation of 800. 

The supply chain consists of a retailer and a supplier. The retailer faces the random demand and gives an order to the supplier. The supplier takes the order and produces it (forced compliance). It has no capacity limit. 

The product sells at 10000 TL per unit which is fixed throughout the year. There is a shortage penalty of 6000 TL/unit for each unit short charged to the retailer. At the end of the year, on-hand inventory has no salvage value.

The supplier produces the product at 3000 TL/unit.

What is the centrally optimal order quantity and the corresponding expected profit? (Assuming that the supplier and the retailer are owned by the same company).
Assuming that the supplier and the retailer are different companies what is the order quantity that the retailer is going to order if the supplier charges a wholesale price of 5550 TL/unit? What are the corresponding (expected) profits of the retailer and the supplier?
The supplier now offers a buy-back contract where she still charges a wholesale price of 5550 TL/unit but offers to buy the remaining items at the end of the year at 1500 TL/unit. What is the order quantity? What are the corresponding expected profits of the retailer and the supplier? Is this a better contract than the one in part (2)?
The supplier now offers a revenue sharing contract where she offers a wholesale price of 4500 TL/unit but asks for 20% of retailer's expected revenue (s=0.80). What is the order quantity? What are the corresponding expected profits of the retailer and the supplier?
Compare the results of 1-4 and discuss why the chain is not coordinated by these contracts with the given contract parameters?
Find a pair of coordinating revenue share parameters (w,s) such that both the retailer and the supplier do better than their profits in part (2) (under a wholesale contract).
